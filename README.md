The way we share information online heavily relies on 𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗸𝘀—whether it's sharing learning resources, job postings or any valuable content. Links help us navigate the vast digital world, but long and cluttered URLs often make them look unappealing and difficult to manage. This is where URL shorteners come into play, making links cleaner, more user-friendly and easier to share.

As a developer, working on real-world projects is the best way to strengthen skills and gain practical experience. With this in mind, I built 𝗦𝗵𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗸𝗜𝘁 - 𝗨𝗥𝗟 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿, a web application that combines my expertise in React and Spring Boot. .
